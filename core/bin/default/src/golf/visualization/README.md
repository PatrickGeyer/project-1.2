==Visualization==
Uses a 3D library to take objects from the input course object and build the corresponding scene.
It should have functions to control camera movements, so that it may be moved by scrolling over the scene for example, or focus on a specific ball.
It should be usuable by the main program for when a game is launched, and by the course builder class.
